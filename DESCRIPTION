Description: software for mining wide-selected ion monitoring/MS2 (Wide-SIM/MS2) mass spectrometry 
 data. wSIMCity was developed by Scott Walmsley, PhD, of the Masonic Cancer Center and the Institute for Health Informatics at the University of Minnesota. 
 Wide-SIM/MS2 is a data-independent acquisition (DIA) strategy adopted from the SWATH methodology to monitor the neutral loss of 2′-deoxyribose (dR) from
 modified 2′-deoxyribonucleosides for DNA adductomic analysis (reference). wSIMCity was developed to overcome data structure issues in Wide-SIM/MS2 data which 
 limited the usefulness of existing software solutions and provides for the automated detection of DNA adducts. The workflow uses R-packages to process Wide-SIM/MS2
 raw data and to mine potential DNA adducts retrospectively. This algorithm can also be applied to detect classes of compounds that share common neutral losses under 
 CID fragmentation.
